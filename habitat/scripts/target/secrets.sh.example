## Script dependencies
# The password the Meteor app will use to connect to a localhost MongoDB
export MONGODB_PWD="?????????";

# The sudoer password for the account that will install Habitat
export TARGET_USER_PWD="?????????";

# The sudoer password to give the 'hab' user account when it is created
export HABITAT_USER_PWD="?????????";

# the client-side path to a key to be added to the remote host authorized_keys file
export HABITAT_USER_SSH_KEY_PATH="/home/you/Desktop/habitat_stuff/habitat_user_id_rsa.pub";


## Nginx certificate dependencies
# the path on the remote server where Nginx should look for SSL cert passwords
export GLOBAL_CERT_PASSWORD_FILE="/home/hab/.ssh/tls/global.pass";

# A string to insert in the Nginx config that will enable
export ENABLE_GLOBAL_CERT_PASSWORD_FILE="global_ssl_password_file = \"ssl_password_file ${GLOBAL_CERT_PASSWORD_FILE};\"";

# The paths to the location of your signed site certificates.
# This is not intended for production use, but for simplifying initial start up and testing
#   example ::
#     export  MYAPP.METEOR.COM_CERT_PATH="/vault/tls/myapp.meteor.com"
#   where ::
#     The shell variable name must be the domain name in upper case and must have the suffix "CERT_PATH".
#     The directory "/vault/tls/myapp.meteor.com" must contain three files named exactly :
#       - server.crt -- the certificate
#       - server.key -- the certificate decryption key
#       - server.pp -- the certificate decryption key pass phrase in plain text
#
# To be clear, all the files, in each directory, will be named server.(suffix), so only the
# directory name will distinguish them.   Obviously a hack.  Should change in the future.

In order to help make deployment release version control easier, HabitatForMeteor requires a release note for each commit and corresponding tag that it creates.

They must be text and must take a name matching the following syntax :

     <semver>_note.txt

Thus, if your release version is 0.1.2, then the release note name must be :

     0.1.2_note.txt
